## What went well
- I felt confident with Git commands. Practicing them repeatedly helped me get comfortable navigating branches, committing changes, and resolving conflicts smoothly.
- While I'm still building confidence, I think I've grasped the basics of Git macro and micro commits.

## What went wrong
- React Hooks were tough to understand, especially managing state with useState and useEffect, and also the asynchronous operations.
- The deployment process was also challenging in our exam.
- My main obstacle was my limited technical background, coding doesn't come naturally to me, so I struggled with the syntax and logic. 

## Key Learnings
- Technically, I gained hands-on skills in Figma for UI/UX design, which let me prototype interfaces quickly and iteratively
- Enhanced my team collaboration abilities, particularly in resolving conflicts and distributing tasks effectively.

## 4. Areas for improvements.
- I want to deepen my understanding of core concepts and logic, so that when I see code, I can quickly grasp what's happening without relying solely on trial and error. For team projects, I'll put in more effort as a UI/UX designer by studying my role thoroughly.

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)
- I want to learn best practices for mobile UI/UX design, like easy thumb layouts, simple navigation, accessibility rules, and touch-friendly features for smooth user experiences.
